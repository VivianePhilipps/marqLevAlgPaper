# marqLevAlgPaper

This repository goes along with the paper "Robust and efficient optimization using a Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm with R Package marqLevAlg (Philipps V, Hejblum BP, Prague M, Commenges D, Proust-Lima C, 2020)" available on arXiv.

It contains all necessary data, packages and R codes to replicate the results shown in the paper.


## marqLevAlg package

The marqLevAlg R package can be downloaded from CRAN (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lcmm) or from github (https://github.com/VivianePhilipps/marqLevAlgParallel).

It should be installed in a preliminary step.

## Other R pacakges

To run part of the R code, the 3 packages CInLPN, JM and lcmmMLA included in the repository as tarballs, should also be installed.

## R code

Once the installations are done, the scripts section4-example.R, section5-benchmark.R and section6-comparison.R can be executed to replicate the results shown in the paper.
